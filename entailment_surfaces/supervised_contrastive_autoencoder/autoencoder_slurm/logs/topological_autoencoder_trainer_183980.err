RESULT MIGHT BE INACURATE
Max number of iteration reached, currently 100000. Sometimes iterations go on in cycle even though the solution has been reached, to check if it's the case here have a look at the minimal reduced cost. If it is very close to machine precision, you might actually have the correct solution, if not try setting the maximum number of iterations a bit higher
